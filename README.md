# Bug Analyzer Agent

The **Bug Analyzer Agent** is an intelligent n8n workflow for automated bug triage, semantic duplicate detection, and AI-powered analysis of GitHub issues. It integrates GitHub, OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone vector search, GPT for analysis, and Slack notifications to accelerate bug management for engineering teams.

---

## Features

- Automated Monitoring: Real-time GitHub issues and comments tracking via webhooks
- Semantic Analysis: Cleans and normalizes issue data for intelligent processing
- Duplicate Detection: Generates OpenAI embeddings and identifies similar bugs using vector database (Pinecone)
- AI-Powered Analysis: Performs GPT-based technical and business analysis with actionable recommendations
- Smart Notifications: Publishes comprehensive analysis and similarity findings to Slack
- Highly Configurable: Fully customizable with environment variables for quick adaptation

---

## Workflow Overview

The Bug Analyzer Agent follows a comprehensive 10-step process:

1. GitHub Trigger: Monitors new issues and comments in designated repositories
2. Prepare Issue Text: Extracts and formats core issue details for semantic processing
3. Generate Embeddings: Sends processed text to OpenAI Embeddings API
4. Process Embeddings: Structures output for vector search and metadata preparation
5. Search Similar Bugs: Queries Pinecone for semantically similar existing bugs
6. Filter Similar Results: Processes and summarizes similarity results
7. Store Bug Vector: Adds new bug vectors to database for future searches
8. AI Analysis: Leverages GPT to analyze context, root cause, impact, and next steps
9. Format Analysis: Cleans and structures AI output for clear reporting
10. Send to Slack: Posts comprehensive results and analysis to designated channel
