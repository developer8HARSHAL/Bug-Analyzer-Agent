# Bug Analyzer Agent
The **Bug Analyzer Agent** is an intelligent n8n workflow for automated bug triage, semantic duplicate detection, and AI-powered analysis of GitHub issues. It integrates GitHub via OAuth2 triggers, Cohere embeddings and chat models, Pinecone vector search with similarity thresholds, and Slack notifications to accelerate bug management for engineering teams.

---

## Features
- Automated Monitoring: Real-time GitHub events tracking via OAuth2 triggers (issues, comments, pushes, pull requests)
- Semantic Analysis: Cleans and normalizes issue data with preprocessing for intelligent processing
- Duplicate Detection: Generates Cohere embeddings and identifies similar bugs using Pinecone vector database with custom similarity thresholds
- AI-Powered Analysis: Leverages Cohere’s command-r-08-2024 chat model to produce technical analysis and actionable recommendations
- Smart Notifications: Publishes comprehensive analysis, similarity counts, and formatted findings to Slack
- Highly Configurable: Fully customizable with environment variables for quick adaptation

---

## Workflow Overview
The Bug Analyzer Agent follows a comprehensive multi-step process:  
1. GitHub OAuth2 Trigger: Monitors new issues, comments, pushes, and pull requests in designated repositories  
2. Preprocess Issue Text: Strips code blocks and URLs, normalizes whitespace, detects severity from labels, caps lengths, generates unique IDs, and enriches metadata  
3. Generate Embeddings: Sends processed text to Cohere Embeddings API (embed-english-v3.0)  
4. Process Embeddings: Structures output for vector search and metadata preparation  
5. Search Similar Bugs: Queries Pinecone using vector query endpoint, applying similarity threshold filtering (e.g., 0.75)  
6. Filter and Summarize Results: Processes similarity results and highlights high similarity cutoff (e.g., 0.85)  
7. Store Bug Vector: Upserts new bug vectors into Pinecone database via upsert endpoint  
8. AI Analysis: Calls Cohere chat model (command-r-08-2024) for root cause, impact, and priority analysis  
9. Format Analysis: Cleans and sections AI output for clear and structured Slack reporting  
10. Send Slack Notification: Posts formatted comprehensive results, similarity counts, and bug details to a fixed Slack channel
